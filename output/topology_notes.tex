\begin{defn}
A \textbf{topology} on a set $X$ is a collection $\tau$ of subsets of $X$ satisfying:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\varnothing, X \in  \tau$
        \item  An intersection of finite subcollections of $\tau$ is in $\tau$
        \item A union of any subcollection of $\tau$ is in $\tau$
    \end{enumerate}
The ordered pair $\left (X, \tau\right )$ is called a \textbf{topological space}.
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
    Let $\left (X, \tau\right )$ be a topological space. An \textbf{open subset} of $X$ is a member of $\tau$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let $\tau$ and $\sigma$ be two topologies on a set $X$. We say that $\tau$ is \textbf{weaker} (or smaller, coarser) than $\sigma$ if $T \subseteq \sigma$. In this case, $\sigma$ is then said to be \textbf{stronger} (or larger, finer) than $\tau$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let $X$ be any set. The collection $\tau = P\left (X\right )$ is a topology on $X$ and is called the \textbf{discrete topology} on $X$. Here $\left (X, \tau\right )$ is called the \textbf{discrete topological space}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let $X$ be any set. The collection $\tau = \left\{ \varnothing, X \right\}$ is called the \textbf{indiscrete topology} on $X$. Here $\left (X, \tau\right )$ is called the \textbf{indiscrete topology}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    Let $X$ be any set. The collection $\tau = \left\{ A \subseteq X  :  X \setminus A \text{ is finite } \right\} \cup \left\{ \varnothing \right\}$ is called the \textbf{co-finite topology}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    Let $X$ be any set. The collection $\tau = \left\{ A \subseteq X  :  X \setminus A \text{ is countable } \right\} \cup \left\{ \varnothing \right\}$ is called the \textbf{co-countable topology}.
\end{defn}



\begin{defn}
A topology $\tau$ on a set $X$ is said to be \textbf{metrizable} if there exists a metric $d$ on $X$ such that the topology $\tau_d$ generated by the metric $d$ coincides with $\tau$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Two metrics defined on a set $X$ are said to be \textbf{equivalent} if they generate the same topology. 
In other words, $d_1$ and $d_2$ are equivalent if the collection of open sets in $\left (X, d_1\right )$ and $\left (X, d_2\right )$ are the same.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
The topology generated by the Euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R} ^n$ is called the \textbf{usual topology} on $\mathbb{R} ^n$.
For $Y \subseteq \mathbb{R} ^n$, the topology generated by the Euclidean metric is called the usual topology on $Y$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
By a \textbf{neighbourhood} of a point $x$ in a topological space $\left (X, \tau\right )$, we mean an open set containing $x$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A subset $A$ of a topological space $\left (X, \tau\right )$ is said to be \textbf{closed} if $X \setminus A$ is open in $X$, that is $X \setminus A \in \tau$
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[]
        \item  $\varnothing$ and $X$ are closed in $X$
        \item An intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed in $X$
        \item A union of a \textit{finite} collection of closed sets in $X$ is closed in $X$
    \end{itemize}
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}
    Let $X$ be a topological space. A collection $\beta$ of open subsets of $X$ is said to be a \textbf{basis} for the topology on $X$ if for every open set $U$ in $X$ and $x \in U$, there exists a $B \in \beta$ such that $x \in B \subseteq U$.

    Members of $\beta$ are called \textbf{basis open sets} corresponding to basis $\beta$.
\end{defn}

\begin{note}
    For any topological space $\left (X, \tau\right )$, $\tau$ is a basis for $\tau$.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
    In $\mathbb{R}$ the set $\left\{ \left (x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon\right )  :  x \in \mathbb{R}\text{ and }\varepsilon >0 \right\}$ is a basis for the usual topology.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
    For $\left (\mathbb{R}, \tau\right )$, where $\tau$ is the discrete topology, $\beta = \left\{ \left\{ x \right\}  :  x \in \mathbb{R} \right\}$ is a basis for $\tau$ on $\mathbb{R}$.

\end{note}

\begin{note}
    In $\mathbb{R}$ the set $\left\{ \left (a, b\right )  :  a,b \in \mathbb{Q}\text{ and }a < b \right\}$ is a basis for the usual topology. This is a countable basis for $\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
    Let $\left (X, \tau\right )$ be a metrizable space. Then $\beta = \left\{ B\left (x, \varepsilon\right )  :  x \in X, \varepsilon >0 \right\}$ is a basis for $\tau$.
\end{note}

\begin{defn}
    Let $\left (X, \tau\right )$ be a topological space. A collection $S \subseteq \tau$ is said to be a \textbf{subbasis} for the topology $\tau$ if for every open set $U$ in $\tau$ and $x \in U$, there exists a finite subcollection $\left\{ S_1, S_2, ..., S_n \right\}$ in $S$ such that $x \in \displaystyle\bigcap_{i = 1}^n S_i \subseteq U$

    Members of $S$ are called \textbf{subbasis open sets} corresponding to $S$.
\end{defn}

\begin{note}
    For a topological space $\left (X, \tau\right )$ a collection $S$ is a subbasis for the topology $\tau$ if and only if the collection of all finite intersections of members in $S$ forms a basis for the topology $\tau$.
\end{note}

\begin{thm}
    Let $\left (X, \tau\right )$ be a topological space and $\beta$ be a collection of open sets in $\left (X, \tau\right )$.

    Then $\beta$ is a basis for the topology $\tau$ on $X$ if and only if every open set $U$ in $\left (X, \tau\right )$ can be written as a union of members in $\beta$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    If $X$ is a set, a basis for a topology on $X$ is a collection $\beta$ of subsets of $X$ such that 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item for every $x \in X$ there exists $B \subset \beta$ containing $x$.
        \item if $x \in B_1 \cap B_2$, for some $B_1, B_2 \in \beta$, then there exists $B_3 \in \beta$ such that $x \in B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}
    The topology generated by the basis $\beta = \left\{ \left [a, b\right )  :  a, b \in \mathbb{R}, a < b \right\}$ is known as the \textbf{lower limit topology} on $\mathbb{R}$. 

    The space $\mathbb{R}$ equipped with the lower limit topology is known as the \textbf{Sorgenfrey line} $\mathbb{R}_l$.
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
    The lower limit topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is strictly finer than the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$
\end{prop}

\begin{defn}
    Let $K = \left\{ \frac{1}{n}  :  n \in \mathbb{N} \right\}$.

    \\ $\tau = \{ U \subseteq X  :  $ for every $ x \in U $ there exists a finite number of members $ S_1, S_2, ..., S_n \in S $ such that $ x \in S_1 \cap S_2 \cap ... \cap S_n \subseteq U \}$ is the topology generated by the subbasis $S$.
\end{thm}

        \item reflexive: $\alpha \leq \alpha$
        \item anti-symmetric: $\alpha \leq \beta$ and $\beta \leq \alpha$ $\implies$ $\alpha = \beta$

\begin{thm}
    The topologies on $\mathbb{R}^n$ induced by the euclidean metric and the square norm are the same as the product topology on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}
    Consider the standard bounded metric on $\mathbb{R}$ defined as $\overline{d} = \min\{ |a-b|, 1\}$.
    Given an index set $I$ and points $x = (x_\alpha)_{\alpha \in I}$ and $y = (y_\alpha)_{\alpha \in I}$, the metric $\rho$ on $\mathbb{R}^I$ defined  as $\rho(x,y) = \sup \{ \overline{d}(x_\alpha, y_\alpha) | \alpha \in I \}$ is known as the \textbf{uniform metric} on $\mathbb{R}^I$.

    The topology generated by the uniform metric is called the \textbf{uniform topology} on $\mathbb{R}^I$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
    The uniform topology on $\mathbb{R}^I$ is weaker than the box topology and stronger than the product topology. 
    All these topologies are different if $I$ is infinite.
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces and let $p: X \to Y$ be a surjective map. 

    The map $p$ is said to be a \textbf{quotient map} provided a subset $U$ of $Y$ is open in $Y$ iff $p^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$.

\begin{defn}
    If $X$ is a topological space and $A$ is any set, and if $p: X \to A$ is a surjective map, then there exists exactly one topology $\tau$ on $A$ relative to which $p$ is a quotient map. This topology is known as the \textbf{quotient topology} induced by $p$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    Let $X$ be a topological space and $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $X$. 

    Define a map $p: X \to \frac{X}{\sim}$ as $p(x) = [x]$ where $[x]$ is the equivalence class of $x$ under $\sim$.

    Let $\tau$ be the quotient topology induced by $p$ on $\frac{X}{\sim}$. Then the space $(\frac{X}{\sim}, \tau)$ is called the \textbf{quotient space} of $X$.
