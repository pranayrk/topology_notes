\begin{defn}
    Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space and $Y \subseteq X$.
    
    The collection $\tau_Y$ is a topology on $Y$ called the \textbf{subspace topology} and with this topology, $Y$ is called a \textbf{subspace} of $X$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
    Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. Then a subset $U$ of $Y$ is open in $Y$ iff $U = V \cap Y$ for some open set $V$ in $X$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    If $\mathscr{B}$ is a basis for the topology on $X$, then the collection $\mathscr{B}_Y = \{ B \cap Y  | B \in \mathscr{B} \}$ is a basis for the subspace topology on $Y$.
\end{thm}



\begin{thm}
    Let $Y$ be an open subspace of $X$. Then a subset $U$ of $Y$ is open in $Y$ iff $U$ is open in $X$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    Let $Y$ be a closed subspace of a topological space $X$. Then a subset $C$ of $Y$ is closed in $Y$ iff it is closed in $X$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    Let $X$ be a topological space and $Y$ be a subspace of $X$.

    Let $C \subseteq Y$. Then $C$ is closed in $Y$ iff there is a closed set $D$ in $X$ such that $Y \cap D = C$
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    Let $X$ be a topological space and $Y$ be a closed subspace of $X$. Let $C \subseteq Y$. Then $C$ is closed in $Y$ iff $C$ is closed in $X$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    If $A$ is a subspace of $X$ and $B$ is a subspace of $Y$, then the product topology on $A \times B$ is the same as the topology $A \times B$ inherits as a subspace of $X \times Y$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    Let $X$ be a topological space and $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. Let $A \subseteq Y$. Then $\text{cl}_X(A) \cap Y = \text{cl}_Y(A)$
