\begin{defn}
A \textbf{topology} on a set $X$ is a collection $\tau$ of subsets of $X$ satisfying:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\varnothing, X \in  \tau$
        \item  An intersection of finite subcollections of $\tau$ is in $\tau$
        \item A union of any subcollection of $\tau$ is in $\tau$
    \end{enumerate}
The ordered pair $\left (X, \tau\right )$ is called a \textbf{topological space}.
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
    Let $\left (X, \tau\right )$ be a topological space. An \textbf{open subset} of $X$ is a member of $\tau$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let $\tau$ and $\sigma$ be two topologies on a set $X$. We say that $\tau$ is \textbf{weaker} (or smaller, coarser) than $\sigma$ if $T \subseteq \sigma$. In this case, $\sigma$ is then said to be \textbf{stronger} (or larger, finer) than $\tau$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let $X$ be any set. The collection $\tau = P\left (X\right )$ is a topology on $X$ and is called the \textbf{discrete topology} on $X$. Here $\left (X, \tau\right )$ is called the \textbf{discrete topological space}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let $X$ be any set. The collection $\tau = \left\{ \varnothing, X \right\}$ is called the \textbf{indiscrete topology} on $X$. Here $\left (X, \tau\right )$ is called the \textbf{indiscrete topology}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    Let $X$ be any set. The collection $\\tau = \left\{ A \subseteq X  :  X \setminus A \text{ is finite } \right\} \cup \left\{ \varnothing \right\}$ is called the \textbf{co-finite topology}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    Let $X$ be any set. The collection $\\tau = \left\{ A \subseteq X  :  X \setminus A \text{ is countable } \right\} \cup \left\{ \varnothing \right\}$ is called the \textbf{co-countable topology}.
\end{defn}



\begin{defn}
A topology $\tau$ on a set $X$ is said to be \textbf{metrizable} if there exists a metric $d$ on $X$ such that the topology $\tau_d$ generated by the metric $d$ coincides with $\tau$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Two metrics defined on a set $X$ are said to be \textbf{equivalent} if they generate the same topology. 
In other words, $d_1$ and $d_2$ are equivalent if the collection of open sets in $\left (X, d_1\right )$ and $\left (X, d_2\right )$ are the same.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
The topology generated by the Euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R} ^n$ is called the \textbf{usual topology} on $\mathbb{R} ^n$.
For $Y \subseteq \mathbb{R} ^n$, the topology generated by the Euclidean metric is called the usual topology on $Y$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
By a \textbf{neighbourhood} of a point $x$ in a topological space $\left (X, \tau\right )$, we mean an open set containing $x$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
A subset $A$ of a topological space $\left (X, \tau\right )$ is said to be \textbf{closed} if $X \setminus A$ is open in $X$, that is $X \setminus A \in \tau$
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[]
        \item  $\varnothing$ and $X$ are closed in $X$
        \item An intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed in $X$
        \item A union of a \textit{finite} collection of closed sets in $X$ is closed in $X$
    \end{itemize}
\end{thm}
