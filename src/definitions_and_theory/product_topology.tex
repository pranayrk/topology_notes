\begin{defn}
    Let $(X, tau sub 1)$ and $(Y, tau sub 2)$ be two topological spaces. The collection $script B = tau sub 1 cross tau sub 2 = {{ u cross v such that u in tau sub 1, v in tau sub 2 }}$ is a basis for a topology on $X cross Y$.
    The topology generated by $script B$ is called the \textbf{product topology} on $X cross Y$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
    Let $(X, tau)$ and $(Y, sigma)$ be two topological spaces. Let $script B$ be a basis for $tau$ and $script C$ be a basis for $sigma$.
    Then the collection $script D = {{ U cross V such that U in script B, V in script C }}$ is a basis for the product topology on $X cross Y$.
\end{thm}

\begin{result}
    The product topology on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ coincides with the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}^2$
\end{result}
