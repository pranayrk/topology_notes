\begin{defn}
    Let $(X, tau)$ be a topological space and $S subset X$. A point $x in X$ is called a \textbf{closure point} of $S$ if for every neighbourhood $U$ of $x$, we have $U intersection S not equal to empty set$.

    The set of all closure points of $S$ is called the \textbf{closure} of $A$ and is denoted $@@\text{cl}@@(A)$ or $A bar$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    A point $x in X$ is said to be a \textbf{limit point} of $S$ if for every neighbourhood of $x$, we have $(U intersection S) minus {{ x }} not equal to empty set $.

    The set of all limit points is called the \textbf{derived set} and is denoted $S'$
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
    Let $X$ be a topological space and $S subset X$. Then $S bar$ is the smallest closed set in $X$ that contains $S$.
\end{thm}

\begin{prop}
    A subset of a topological space $X$ is closed if and only if $S = S bar$
\end{prop}

\begin{thm}
    Let $(X, tau)$ be a metrizable space and $S subset X$. Then $x in S bar$ if and only if there exists a sequence $<xn>$ in $S$ such that $xn tends to x$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    Let $X$ be a topological space and $S subset X$. Then show that $x in S bar$ if and only if there exists a net $< x sub lambda >$ in $S$ such that $ x sub lambda tends to x$
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}
        Let $X$ be a topological space and $A subset of X$. A point $x in X$ is said to be an \textbf{interior point} of $A$ if there exists a neighbourhood $U$ of $X$ such that $U subset of A$ (or) if there exists an open set $U$ in $X$ such that $x in U subset A$.

        The set of all interior points of $A$ is called the \textbf{interior} of $A$ and is denoted $A interior$.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
    Let $X$ be a topological space and $S subset X$. Then $S interior$ is the largest open set contained in $S$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    Let $X$ be a topological space and $S subset X$. Then $S$ is open if and only if $S = S interior$.
