\begin{defn}
    Let $X$ be a topological space. A collection $\mathscr{A} = \{ A_\alpha \}_{\alpha \in I}$ of open subsets of $X$ is said to be an \textbf{open cover} of $X$ if $X = \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_\alpha$.


    By a \textbf{finite subcover} of $X$, we mean a finite subcollection of $\mathscr{A}$ that itself is a cover of $A$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    A topological space $X$ is said to be \textbf{compact} if everyopen cover of $X$ has a finite subcover.
\end{defn}
