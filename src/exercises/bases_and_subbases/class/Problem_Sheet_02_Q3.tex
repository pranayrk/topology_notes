\begin{ex}
Show that a collection $script A$ of subsets of $S$ that is closed under finite intersection, partially ordered by the reverse set inclusion (that is, for $A, B in script A$, $A less than B$ if $A superset B$) is a directed set. Here for $A,B in script A$, $A intersection B in script A$ and $A superset A intersection B$ and $B superset of A intersection B$.
