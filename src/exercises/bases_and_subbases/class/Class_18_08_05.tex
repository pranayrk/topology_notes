\begin{ex}
Let $S$ be a subbasis for a topology on $X$. Then show that 
\\ $tau = @@\{@@ U subset X such that $ for every $ x in U $ there exists a finite number of members $ S1, S2, ..., Sn in S $ such that $ x in S1 intersection S2 intersection ... intersection Sn subset U @@\}@@$ is a topology generated by the subbasis $S$.
