Consider $(X, tau)$ where $tau$ is the discrete topology. Then the collection of closed sets is the power set $P(X)$ which coincides with the collection open sets in $(X, tau)$.\\
Consider $(X, tau)$ where $tau$ is the co-finite topology. Then the collection of closed sets in $(X, tau)$ is $ {{ A in tau such that A @@\text{ is finite }@@ }} union {{ X }} $.
