        \item Consider $(X, tau)$ where $tau$ is the discrete topology. Then show that the collection of closed sets in $(X, tau)$ is the power set $P(X)$
        \item Consider $(X, tau)$ where $tau$ is the co-finite topology. Then show that the collection of closed sets in $(X, tau)$ is $ {{ A subset X such that A @@\text{ is finite }@@ }} union {{ X }} $.
