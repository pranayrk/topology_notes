 Given a topological space $(X, tau)$, show that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $empty set$ and $X$ are closed in $X$
        \item An intersection of any collection of closed sets is closed in $X$
        \item A union of a finite collection closed sets in $X$ is closed in $X$
    \end{enumerate}
